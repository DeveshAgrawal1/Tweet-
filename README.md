# Tweet-Plus
Google Chrome extension to share individual tweets on Google Plus.

This is a practice project I built to learn Google chrome extension development. 
I will also incorporate other functionalities like rich notifications as I learn them.

The extension is not available on Google chrome store. To test it, please do the following:
  1. Clone the repository using 
  ``` git clone https://github.com/DeveshAgrawal1/Tweet-Plus.git ```
  2. Go to Google Chrome extension settings and check on Developer mode.
  3. Click load unpacked extension and select the repository folder.
